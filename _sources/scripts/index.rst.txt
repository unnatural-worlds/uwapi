Scripts
=======
Guide on making scripts for custom maps for Unnatural Worlds.

.. warning::
	Making custom scripts is not yet fully supported.

Scripts can be written in any language that can be compiled into `WASM <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebAssembly>`_.

The uwapi repository provides c/c++ headers for scripts.
If you want to use another language, you will need to specify all the imported functions and structures yourself.
