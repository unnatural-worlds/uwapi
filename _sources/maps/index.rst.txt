Guide on making custom maps for Unnatural Worlds.

.. warning::
   Making custom maps is not yet fully supported.

A map for UW is a collection of assets, and some additional required files.
It may contain :ref:`prototypes <concepts/prototypes:Prototypes>`, :ref:`scripts <scripts/index:Scripts>`, models, sounds, etc.

Assets found in a map have precedence over assets in the base game.
